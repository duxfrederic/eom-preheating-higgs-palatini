# What is this?
A simple Mathematica notebook that calculates equations of motion. The said equations are calculated in the unitary gauge, for a complex U(1) Higgs and for the full SU(2) doublet. This only applies to the Einstein frame version of the action, in the Palatini formulation of gravity, with a homogeneous FLRW background.  


One can adapt the notebook by modifying the lagrangian densities at the top of each section, e.g. by adding back the covariant derivatives of each case to include the gauge bosons.
